# The Definitive Guide to Building a Machine Learning Research Platform from Scratch

![Cover Image](./chapters/images/cover.png)

This guide is for **academic institutions and research labs** ready to establish their first cohesive machine learning research platform. We’ve designed these chapters for the IT directors, principal investigators, and system architects tasked with building a unified environment where every researcher -- from the first-year student to the seasoned postdoc -- can train models efficiently. Whether you are starting with a single "under-the-desk" GPU server or scaling to a university-wide cluster, this guide provides the technical blueprints and strategic philosophy needed to turn raw hardware into a world-class discovery engine.

In this guide we are not attempting to list **every** possibility but, rather, to offer the most common "tried and tested" configuations, with a biast to modern, simple tooling, that is open source and easy to maintain.

> **Note:** This is a "living book" written on GitHub. We are looking for contributions from industry and academic experts to make recommendations. Use the links below to navigate the chapters. Found a mistake? Open an **Issue** or submit a **Pull Request**.
