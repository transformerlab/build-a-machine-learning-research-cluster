# Building a Small SkyPilot + k3s Cluster - Install Instructions

Here are full step-by-step instructions for setting up a small (e.g., 3-5 node) cluster to work in a shared environment.

We recommend using SkyPilot and k3s for this configuration. This setup provides excellent scalability, allowing you to easily grow the system to 50 nodes or more by leveraging Kubernetes as your underlying layer.
